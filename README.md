# clojure-spec-seq

Creates a lazy seq of spec paths given a starting root spec.

## Usage

```clojure
(s/def :x/parent (s/keys :req [:x/name] :opt [:x/child]))
(s/def :x/child (s/keys :req [:x/name] :opt [:x/toy]))
(s/def :x/name string?)
(s/def :x/toy #{"Rubik's Cube" "Legos" "Xbox"})

(spec-seq :x/parent)
; => ({:spec-name :x/name, :depth 1, :path [:x/name], :req? true}
;     {:spec-name :x/child, :depth 1, :path [:x/child], :req? false}
;     {:spec-name :x/name, :depth 2, :path [:x/child :x/name], :req? true}
;     {:spec-name :x/toy, :depth 2, :path [:x/child :x/toy], :req? false})
```

This really comes in handy when we are dealing with specs that have cycles.

```clojure
(s/def :x/gossiper (s/keys :req [:x/rumor]))
(s/def :x/rumor (s/keys :req [:x/gossiper]))
```

In this case, we would generate a lazy infinite sequence. We can use things
like `take-while` to limit our sequence of child and descendant specs to those
less than a maximum depth

```clojure
(->> (spec-seq :x/gossiper)
     (take-while #(>= 3 (:depth %))))
; => ({:spec-name :x/rumor, :depth 1, :path [:x/rumor], :req? true}
;     {:spec-name :x/gossiper, :depth 2, :path [:x/rumor :x/gossiper], :req? true}
;     {:spec-name :x/rumor, :depth 3, :path [:x/rumor :x/gossiper :x/rumor], :req? true})
```

If you want to decorate the sequence members with more information (e.g., if
the spec corresponds to an integer; if the spec corresponds to a leaf node or
not), you can do so via a vector of middleware functions that you can pass as a
second argument to `spec-seq`. A middleware function is merely a decorator
function that takes the sequence member an a single argument and returns a new
sequence member.

```clojure
(let [middleware [#(assoc % :path-len (-> % :path count))]]
  (->> (spec-seq :x/gossiper)
       (take-while #(>= 3 (:depth %)) middleware)))
; => ({:spec-name :x/rumor, :depth 1, :path [:x/rumor], :req? true, :path-len 1}
;     {:spec-name :x/gossiper, :depth 2, :path [:x/rumor :x/gossiper], :req? true, :path-len 2}
;     {:spec-name :x/rumor, :depth 3, :path [:x/rumor :x/gossiper :x/rumor], :req? true, :path-len 3})
```
